### How-to
In the main.py file there is a nested list where you input all of the suggested exercises from the lecturer in a week by week format, i.e [[wk1:ex1, wk1:ex2, ...], [wk2:ex1], ...]]. Then manually write in the arr_sizes array the maximum number of exercises to be taken from each week, i.e arr_sizes[0] == 1 if you only wish for 1 exercise from week 1 to be taken each time you run the code, these numbers should total the amount of exercises per run you wish to receive.   
The script then randomly chooses exercises from each week, saving this data to a file to avoid repeating exercises on each run.
